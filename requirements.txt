# Python Dependencies for COMPSs ML Models

## Core Dependencies
torch>=2.0.0
xgboost>=1.7.0
numpy>=1.21.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
joblib>=1.1.0

## Analysis and Visualization (Optional)
matplotlib>=3.5.0
pandas>=1.3.0
seaborn>=0.11.0

## Installation

### Basic Installation (Model Execution Only)
```bash
pip install torch xgboost numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

### Full Installation (Including Analysis Tools)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Alternative: Conda Installation
```bash
conda install pytorch numpy scikit-learn joblib -c pytorch
conda install xgboost matplotlib pandas seaborn -c conda-forge
```

## Version Notes

- **PyTorch**: Models were trained with PyTorch 2.x. CPU version is sufficient for inference.
- **XGBoost**: Version 1.7+ recommended for compatibility with saved models.
- **Python**: Requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Platform Compatibility

All dependencies are cross-platform and work on:
- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

## Minimal Requirements

For deployment in resource-constrained environments, only these are essential:
```
torch
xgboost
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
```

The analysis scripts (ffnn_analysis.py, xgboost_analysis.py) require matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn, but are not needed for model inference.
